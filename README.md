ChordCalcComposer
=================

ChordCalcComposer is an attempt at creating a truly touch-oriented interface for interacting with and editing scores.
The base app, ChordCalc, is merely a keyboard which converts input into chord symbols.  This output can be used to
easily generate a lead sheet by non-composers.

**Contribute**

ChordCalc could use a number of contributions.  The main targets include:

* an improved (possibly native) audio engine, ideally with support for SoundFonts
* a completed score display engine

**IDE support**

ChordCalc was started in AIDE, resumed on the Eclipse Android SDK and has most recently transitioned to Android Studio.
In making these transitions I have attempted to maintain backwards compatibility, so any of these IDEs should work for
making changes and building.
